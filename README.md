#AQI-forecasting
The data used for this project was obtained from the historical air quality database of the target region. In order to create a model that accurately predicts PM2.5 

These datasets share the following features: 

*Station (Estaci√≥n), Fecha (Date), Hora (Hour), O3 (Ozone), NO (Nitrogen Oxide), NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), NOX (Nitrogen Oxides), CO (Carbon Monoxide), PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter less than 2.5 micrometers), PM10 (Fine Particulate Matter less than 10 micrometers), TMP (Temperature), TMPI (Internal Temperature), RH (Relative Humidity), PBA (Barometric Pressure), WS (Wind Speed), WD (Wind Direction), PP (Precipitation), Solar Radiation (RS), and UVI (UV Index).*
